# Week2-CSS-Bootstrap
My Portfolio created with Bootstrap to have a all in one location that houses my Projects, LinkedIn account, Resume, and Github account to provide access to all of my public respositories!


<---Previous Use Below--->
This was previously "Week 2 Homework - creating a portfolio using bootstrap" it didnt have the projects on the portfolio page, it didnt have my resume, linkedIn, or github linked anywhere on the portfolio.
